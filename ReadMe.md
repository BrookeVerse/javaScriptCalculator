Simple Calculator Project

This calculator project can be used to do simple math equations such as; addition, subtraction, multiply, divide and percentages. I have used Javascript to build this, which has allowed me to use its calling on functions, which wil provide the answers in the display. In the Javascript I have used eventListeners so that when a button is used it will call to a function. That function will then update Variables, these variables are being used by a switch case so that when an operator button is pressed it knows which mathmatical function to call upon. Once the equals button has been clicked it knows to push the results of the equation on to the display.

This is my first javaScript project so when building this I came across some issues. Mostly it was understanding how to have the inputs from clicking the number buttons stored and be able to be used later. Another issue I had was in understanding how to have the switch case use the mathmatical equation and then present that in the display.

I hope to add more features soon such as;
Being able to continue math functions from the result of an answer.
Not having to press clear to start a new equation.
Being able to do more complex equations.

This project was created through my training with the \_nology team, so credit for this project can also go to the instructors on the team. I also worked with a collegue Karin which together we worked hard to solve the issues we were having putting together the code for this project.
